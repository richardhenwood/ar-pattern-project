## About

The project solves a problem I have. I have created a parametric pattern with
[Seamly2D](https://github.com/FashionFreedom/Seamly2D) and I want to
transfer markings onto fabric. I do not have a large format printer.

## Workflow

1. Use Seamly2D to create my shirt pattern pieces. 
2. In Seamly2D generate a layout and export it to SVG. 
3. Load the SVG into [Inkscape](https://github.com/inkscape/inkscape) and manually adjust pieces if necessary.
4. Load the SVG into [ar-project-pattern](https://github.com/richardhenwood/ar-pattern-project) and use my Meta Quest 3 to mark the pattern onto my fabric with chalk. 
5. I cut out the pattern and sew it up.

## Alternatives

 + Use some tools to convert the large SVG into multiple A4 pages for printing. Print them and then tape them together.
 + Use a projector to project the pattern onto fabric. This requires calibration of the projector.
